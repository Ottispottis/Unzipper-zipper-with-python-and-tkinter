A simple zip/unzip program I made with python and tkinter.

Known issue is that when zipping a file from a directory that isn't the same directory where the script is located the program creates empty folders inside the zip according to the path where the file that is zipped was located. This is due to the way ZipFiles write works and I haven't figured out how I could deal with this yet.
